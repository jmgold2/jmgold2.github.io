<h1>Placeholder Title: VRCathedral Game</h1>
  <hr>
<h2>Project Goals</h2>
  <p>This project aims to provide an immersive learning experience for people to explore and engage with gothic architecture 
    using a 1:1 scale virtualization of the Notre Dame de Reims.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Approach</h2>
  <p>The game was originally built in Unreal Engine 4, but we have now moved it to the current version of Unreal Engine, 5.0.3. 
    The cathedral model was created using LiDAR scans of the Notre Dame de Reims provided by the Université de Liège.
    Pictures of the cathedral from Dr. Feltman and the University of Iowa were used to create the textures for the model.<br></p>
  <p><br>In the current build of the game, users are placed directly into the cathedral, and can immediately begin their exploration of the interior.
    Users have the freedom to explore how they'd like, but at specific areas of architectural interest there are objects users can interact with that display text describing the area and its importance in gothic architecture.</p>
