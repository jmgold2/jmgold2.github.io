<h1>PlaceHolder Title: VRCathedral Game</h1>
  <hr>
<h2>Project Goals</h2>
  <p>This project aims to provide an immersive learning experience for people to explore and engage with Gothic Architecture, 
    using a 1:1 scale virtualization of the Notre Dame de Reims.<p>
<hr>
<h3>Approach<h3>
  <p>The game was originally built in UnReal Engine 4, but we have now moved it to the current version of UnReal Engine, 5.0.3.<br> 
    The cathderal model was created using LIDAR scans of the Notre Dame de Reims provided by the Université de Liège.<br>
    Pictures of the cathedral, from Dr. Feltman and the University of Iowa, were used to create the textures for the cathedral.<br><p>
