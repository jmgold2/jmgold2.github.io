<h1>Notre Dame de Reims VR Game</h1>
  <hr>
<h2>Project Goals</h2>
  <p>This project aims to provide an immersive learning experience for people to explore and engage with gothic architecture 
    using a 1:1 scale virtualization of the Notre Dame de Reims. For further information, visit Dr. Feltman's website <a href="https://www.jenniferfeltman.com/vrcathedral" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
<hr>
<h2>Approach</h2>
  <p>The game was originally built in Unreal Engine 4, but has now been moved to Unreal Engine 5.0.3. 
    The cathedral model was created using LiDAR scans of the Notre Dame de Reims provided by the Université de Liège.
    Pictures of the cathedral from Dr. Feltman and the University of Iowa were used to create the textures for the model.<br></p>
  <p><br>Originally, the user was placed into the cathedral directly and could explore the cathedral with textboxes that held information about the cathedral.
    Now, users are spawned into a tutorial room that provides more clear player control instructions. They can then enter the antechamber with a recap of the controls and traversal between the student and teacher game modes. The teacher game mode is a bare version of the cathedral and the student mode is an interactive, gamified archtiecture puzzle.</p>
